# Circulating Tumor DNA-Based Copy-Number Profiles Enable Monitoring Treatment Effects During Therapy in High-Grade Serous Carcinoma

- This github contains pipeline scripts and results from CNAs calling pipeline from targeted sequencing (Oseq) data.
- Tissue Biopsy and Plasma samples collected from High-Grade Serous Carcinoma (HGSC) patients
- There are 152 plasma samples collected longitudinally along the treatment to evaluate the genomic changes based on Copy-Number profiles
